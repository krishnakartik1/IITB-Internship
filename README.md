# IIT Bombay, IEOR Department Internship

This is a repository for the work I've done in IIT Bombay during the internship.

Studied and implemented the paper "Analytics for an Online Retailer: Demand Forecasting and Price Optimization‚Äù. Since the dataset used in the research paper is private, I couldn't write the code for preprocessing the dataset. Rest of the code is in the [research paper](researchpaper/) folder.
